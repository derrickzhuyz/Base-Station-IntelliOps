Contributor: ZYZ, MXY, LJJ

Dataset source: Desensitization data released by Chinese telecom and Huawei in the National Big Data Challenge Competition

* Analysed tens of thousands of data about 67 KPI performance indicators of operator base stations within 29 days, focusing on the application scenarios of intelligent operation and maintenance;
* Realised the early warning mechanism of abnormality and helped engineers to prevent problems in advance by conducting anomalies detection, abnormality prediction and trend prediction for three core indicators of different cells;
* Used multiple cloud server resources within the group to build a cluster, so as to realize the parallelization of computing.
